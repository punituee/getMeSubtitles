# getMeSubtitles
Code searches for subs on subscene.com and gets the closest matching one to the same folder that the movie is present in.
Uses beautifulsoup to parse the webpage
Uses levenshtein distance to get the closest match with the movie title and substitle's file name

Note: I developed this project for personal use, and as a learning exercise. I acknowledge that websites need visitors for revenue and bots like this should be used only in dire circumstances.
